# Project_1

I decided to do the "Hang Man" game with a little twist.
I will use Penny Wise from "IT" as the character being hung.

I deployed my site on Netlify.com (Here is my link "https://stoic-fermi-9b54b0.netlify.com")
My Project Board Link (https://trello.com/b/oPvbzG2Q/project-1)

I will have a landing page with a start button that will trigger a intro video leading to the game.
Once the video is done playing, the gamepage will load on click and the player can start playing game.
The player will have 6 tries to guess the correct phrase.

If the player guesses wrong, a life will be taken away.
If the player guesses right, the letters in the answer will populate.

Everything seems to work as planned.
