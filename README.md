# Project_1

I decided to do the "Hang Man" game with a little twist.

I will use Penny Wise from "IT" as the character being hung.

The title font shown is downloaded from DaFont.com with the font title of "Dracula".

I will have a landing page with a start button that will trigger a intro video leading to the game.

Once the video is done playing, the gamepage will load and the player can start playing game.

They player will have 6 tries to guess the correct phrase. If so
